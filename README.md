# Drought-Prediction-In-California-Using-ML-and-DL-Algorithms
This Project is to predict the drought area percentage in California state using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms
In this Project, three different datasets have been taken and were added above. Drought data, Climatic Data and NDVI data was extracted from Satellite Images using GeoPy module.
Each dataset was cleaned and transformed and all the code was given in Scripts Folder
Unified Dataset was prepared from all three datasets based on the common features such as County and Date.
That unified dataset was then used for modeling using Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, LSTM and ANN by splitting the data into Train and Test sets in such a form that the training data was considered for 19 years and the test dataset was considered as 1 year as the data is Time Series.
